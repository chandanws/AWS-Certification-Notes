# API Gateway ([FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/faqs/))

API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale.

## Features
 - Caching: Cache endpoint's response. API gateway caches responses from your endpoint for a specified time to live. API gateway responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead of making a request to your endpoint.
 - Caching capabilities improve performance
 - Low cost & effecient
 - Scales effortlessly
 - You can throttle requests to prevent attacks
 - Connect to Cloudwatch to log all requests

**Note:** Cross-origin resource sharing (CORs) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first response was served.
